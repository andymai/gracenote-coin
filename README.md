# Gracenote Coin (GNC)

Gracenote Coin (GNC) is a scrypt-based crypto-currency derived from Bitcoin. GNC was created as a hackathon project while I was working at Gracenote with the goal of replacing Gracenote paper-based employee rewards system with a cryptocurrency.

All 10,000,000 coins were pre-mined and air dropped to department leaders. Department heads could then distribute GNC to employee wallets as tokens of appreciations. GNC was redeemable for company swag thus solving the crumbling runaway inflation caused by Gracenote's fiat employee rewards system. /s
